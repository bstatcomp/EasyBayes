\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{extract}}{Extract from Stan fit.}

\item{\code{mu}}{Optional variable: mean value for comparison with first group.}

\item{\code{sigma}}{Optional variable: standard deviation for comparison with first group, used in combination with `mu` parameter.}

\item{\code{rope}}{Optional variable: rope interval used in comparisons.}
}}

\examples{
summary(`ttest_results`): prints difference/equality of the first group against the second group, against a mean value, or against a normal distribution with a defined mean value and variance.

compare_groups(`ttest_results`): prints difference/equality of the first group against the second group, against a mean value, or against a normal distribution with a defined mean value and variance.

plot_difference(`ttest_results`): a visualization of the difference of the first group against the second group, against a mean value, or against a normal distribution with a defined mean value and variance.

plot_comparison(`ttest_results`): plots histogram for the first group and the histogram of the second group, or a mean value in case second group is defined as a normal distribution or as a constant.

compare_distributions(`ttest_results`): draws samples from distribution of the first group and compares them against samples from the second group, against a mean value, or against samples from a normal distribution with a defined mean value and variance.

plot_distributions(`ttest_results`): a visualization of the distribution for the first group and the distribution or a constant value for the second group.

plot_distributions_difference(`ttest_results`): a visualization of the difference between the distribution of the first group and the distribution or a constant value for the second group.
