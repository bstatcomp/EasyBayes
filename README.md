# bayes4psy
A library intended to simplify the use of Bayesian statistics in R.

# 0.1
Implementation of Bayesian t-test.

# 0.1.1
Implementation of reaction times model.

# 0.1.2
Implementation of the success rate model.

# 0.1.3
Expanded documentation of functions and classes. Consolidate functions and parameter passing between all models.

# 0.1.4
Integrated linear model into the package.
Changed version numbering.
Using HDI instead of CI now.

# 0.2
Cross platform compilation.
Package now passes CRAN checks (with a lot of warnings and notes).
Documentation.

# 0.3
Removed all possible warnings.
CRAN ready!

# 0.4
Large update to documentation, which is now CRAN compliant.
Added an additional, more detailed diagnostic print of fit.
Updates to various visualisations.
Bayesian bootstrap implementation.
Tidyverse style code.

# 0.5
Color model implementation.
Specific visualizations for colors.
Success rate hierarchical model rework.
Extended documentation.
Multiple chains support.

# 0.6
Flexible setting of priors on all of the model's parameters.
The plot_fit functionf for hierarchical models now allows visual inspection of a fit on top and bottom levels.
Added functions for easy extraction of parameter values.

# 0.7
Functions for comparing multiple fits at the same time.
Revised prior system so it is now more user friendly.
